## 悠悠岁月

Everything will be in a second. The dictionary of words amassed between cradle and deathbed, eliminated. All there will be is silence and no words to say it. Nothing will come out of the open mouth, neither I nor me. Language will continue to put the world into words. In conversation around a holiday table, we will be nothing but a first name, increasingly faceless, until we vanish into the vast anonymity of a distant generation.

一切都会在一秒钟内被抹去。在摇篮到临终床之间累积成字典的词汇会消失。所有剩下的只有寂静，且无法诉说。张开的嘴什么也说不出，包括自我。语言会继续把世界变为词汇。在节假日餐桌旁的谈话里，我们将只是个名字，面目越来越模糊，直至消失为匿名的，遥远的一代人
